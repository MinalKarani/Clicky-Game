This app is a memory game.
The app renders 12 different images. Each image should only be clicked once. If it is clicked more than once, the user loses. 
The app keeps track of the user's score and the top score. If the user clicks an image more than once, they lose and a message appears indicating that they lost and should try again.
The top score shows the user the most different clicks they have gotten. After each click, the board shuffles the images in a random order. The score is reset when a user loses, and the game restarts. The game also restarts if a user wins. 

Technologies used : HTML, CSS, Reactjs and Bootstrap.
